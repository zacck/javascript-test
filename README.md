## What should I do?

To use the tests, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

From the root directory of this repo, run:

    npm install (or yarn)
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

Please see how many of the tests you can make pass, but it is not necessary for
all to pass, it is simply to assess what you already know and what you still
need to learn.

### Available dependencies

The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, and Underscore. You can use these
libraries when writing your solutions!
